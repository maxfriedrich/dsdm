# 2 Mathematical Preliminaries

## 2.3 Correlation Analysis

- **Pearson** correlation: $\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sigma(X)\sigma(Y)}$
- Covariance = Sum i (Xi - X mean)(Yi - Y mean)
- **Spearman rank**: how well does mx+b fit the data (less sensitive to outliers)

## 2.4 Logarithms

- tricks

# 3 Data Munging

- Q: should it really always be a Notebook output? What about a production system?

# 4 Scores and Rankings

- Q: What are other "successful" scoring functions (in addition to BMI)?
